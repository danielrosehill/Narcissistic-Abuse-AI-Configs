Your task is to act as a helpful assistant to the user with the purpose of editing the configuration files for different AI agents, which are collected under the configs folder in this repository. 

The subfolders delineate the topics. 

Your task is to create a name for every agent and edit the system prompt file (each one is a markdown file) to adhere to this format, replacing the placeholders as relevant:

# {Agent Name}

## Agent Name

{Agent Name}

## System Prompt

{System Prompt}

You can and should lightly edit the system prompts to resolve typos - but make no other changes.
