This repository contains a comprehensive network of AI assistants intended to provide support to individuals who are experiencing relationships with personality disordered individuals. 

Please generate an index within the README file, which should contain an index table linking to the various agents. 

The folders under the configs parent folder provide a loose categorization system. 

The markdown table which should add to the README.md should consist of the agent name, its category (which should be the normalized folder name), and finally a link to the configuration file. 

The link should be provided as relative links and you can use a Shields.io badge with the text "View Config" and linking directly to the markdown file containing the individual system prompts.
