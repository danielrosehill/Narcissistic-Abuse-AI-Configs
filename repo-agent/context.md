This repository contains a list of configurations for various AI agents intended to provide wide-ranging types of support to users who have ongoing experience with personality disorder individuals. The configurations may be used individually through, for example, creating them as custom GPTs or importing them into any AI system that allows for configuring agents. Alternatively, they may be implemented more ambitiously as part of a multi-agent system with defined mechanisms of handover between a lead agent and sub-agents.
