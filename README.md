# Narcissistic Abuse AI Support Configurations

A comprehensive network of AI agent configurations designed to provide support for individuals affected by relationships with personality disordered individuals, particularly those with Cluster B disorders and narcissistic personality disorder.

## Important Disclaimer

**These tools are not replacements for professional mental health support.** They are intended as adjuncts to professional therapeutic care. Most configurations contain explicit guardrail instructions emphasizing this limitation. If you are in crisis or need immediate support, please contact a mental health professional or crisis helpline.

## üéØ Purpose

This repository captures a wide range of therapeutic use cases for AI assistance, providing fast and positive support for those living with the painful and destructive patterns of behavior exhibited by personality disordered individuals. While not intended as a definitive list, it provides a strong foundation that may be expanded in the future.
